					<p>TREASURE ACADEMY is an academy facility which has been established by YG
					Entertainment, the company which has trained and nurtured top talents of
					our era, through an unmatched and structured training system. Therefore,
					it is an education center for the culture and arts and where we share YG
					culture, centered around dance and vocal, learned through our long
					experience.					
					</p>
					<p>Through the careful and detailed guidance of the famous YG-affiliated
					trainers such as YG/YGX’s exclusive dance team HITECH, CRAZY and NWX
					(who have and currently are on stage with artists such as BIGBANG,
					WINNER, iKON, and BLACKPINK) and vocal trainers who appear on TV
					audition programs(and are currently active within the entertainment
					industry), trainees of all ages and gender – ranging from future celebrity
					aspirants to hobbyists and beginner to experienced-professional applicants
					– will be able to experience an interactive training environment equivalent
					to the current YG singers at our facility.
